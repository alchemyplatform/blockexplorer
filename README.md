# Ethereum Block Explorer

Building my own Ethereum Block Explore using Ethereum JSON-RPC API and the `ethers.js` library giving us the ability to query the Ethereum blockchain and make transactions!

npm start

Running the command above will run the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The webpage will automatically reload when you make code changes.

What you'll see in the browser is Ethereum Mainnet's current block number. 

## To-do

- Connecting the dots.
  - Allow users to click on a block listed in the webpage to get the block's details including its list of transactions
  - From the list of transactions allow users to click on specific transactions to get the details of the transaction
- Make an accounts page where a user can look up their balance or someone else's balance.
